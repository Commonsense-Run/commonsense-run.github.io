## Surveys & Position Papers

- [Programs with Common Sense](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/mcc59.html){: target="_blank"}
    - [John McCarthy](http://jmc.stanford.edu/){: target="_blank"}, 1958, in Proc. of Teddington Conference on the Mechanization of Thought Processes
    - "Programs with Common Sense was probably the first paper on logical AI, i.e. AI in which logic is the method of representing information in computer memory and not just the subject matter of the program. ... It may also be the first paper to propose common sense reasoning ability as the key to AI."

- [Artificial Intelligence, Logic and Formalizing Common Sense](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/ailogic.html){: target="_blank"}
    - [John McCarthy](http://jmc.stanford.edu/){: target="_blank"}, 1990
    - "This is a position paper about the relations among artificial intelligence (AI), mathematical logic and the formalization of common-sense knowledge and reasoning. It also treats other problems of concern to both AI and philosophy. The position advocated is that philosophy can contribute to AI if it treats some of its traditional subject matter in more detail and that this will advance the philosophical goals also."
