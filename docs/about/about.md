# Guide
 

The guide here provides an introduction designed for developers, undergraduates and post-graduates with no prior experience in the world of planning & scheduling and/or optimisation research. 

It is not a substitute for a thorough academic course, or the copious amounts of academic literature written on planning but does provide a solid basis from which to understand and use planning.

The guide is constantly being developed and improved, so if you have any criticisms or feedback we really do truly value it. Especially if you're not a planning expert, as you're the target of this guide!
